# (Same as nagle1, only delay is set to 600ms after connection is established)
# The goal is to show that second segment is not send until the first is acked.
# Assuming mss ~1450
/etc/delay 600
send 1300
wait 1
send 1200
# waiting for a bit so that leftover data will not be transmitted by socket closing
wait 3000
# restoring...
