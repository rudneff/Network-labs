# testing nagle algorithm
# (Same as nagle2, only segment size is made small to theoretically allow collapsing segments on retransmit)
# The goal is to show that second segment is not send until the first is acked.
# Assuming mss ~1450
/etc/delay 600
send 600
wait 1
send 500
# waiting for a bit so that leftover data will not be transmitted by socket closing
wait 3000
# restoring...
/etc/delay 0
